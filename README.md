# Static Page With Sass

Live demo: [static-page-with-sass.vercel.app](https://static-page-with-sass.vercel.app)

One of my first projects and since I like the design I decided to add it to my github. Here my main focus was to create a nice layout for the content using flex-boxes and girds in sass. This project was designed for desktop and large screens.
